    "Previous notebooks have developed the tools and methodology required to implement the RID workflow. Note that the programme for 2017 - 2020 requires some changes, which are described [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/rid/blob/master/notebooks/programme_changes_2017-18.ipynb). In particular, we now have 20 \"core\" sites and 135 \"other\" sites, instead of the previous 11/36/108 split.\n",

The RESA2 database now contains a complete record of all the discharge data required for this year's RID processing.\n",

    "\n",
    "The analysis for the RID report should only use water samples collected as part of the \"core\" monitoring programme (i.e. not flood samples or those collected under Option 3). In 2018, **no flood samples were taken**, but the **Option 3 samples need to be separated from the \"core\" sampling**, as agreed with Øyvind and Hans Fredrik (see e-mail from Hans Fredrik received 09.08.2019 at 08.16 for full details).\n",
