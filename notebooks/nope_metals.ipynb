    "# NOPE metals\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to develop an extension module for NOPE to simulate metals. It's not clear yet exactly how this should be done, but the first step is to explore some of the datasets sent by Øyvind following our meeting in Grimstad in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Data from Øyvind\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1. Spatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the raw datasets is a little unusual. It was originally sent to Øyvind by Anders Finstad and then forwarded on to me (see e-mail from Øyvind received 28/09/2017 at 15.52). The file is called *ecco_biwa_db_storage.csv* and it's large (nearly 700 MB). Anders hasn't provided much background information, but it looks as though this is a direct dump from a spatial database and the file includes hexadecimal-encoded Well-Known Binary (WKB) spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The original file includes duplicated column headings `geom` and `ebint` (it looks as though this is due to a previous spatial join). I have therefore renamed the first occurrences to `geom2` and `ebint2`, respectively, to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file contains a huge amount of data (nearly 500 columns), so it'll take a bit of figuring out. I also need to parse the hex-encoded WKB into something that I can display on a map."

    "It is possible to use [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely) to parse the WKB data, which converts the dataframe to a geodataframe. My intial idea was to then save this as a shapefile for display in ArcGIS. However, the column names in the file are too long for the shapefile format, and naming conflicts arise when the columns are truncated. An alternative is therefore to save the data in GeoJSON format, which is more flexible. Unfortunately, there's then no way to read this using ArcMap. QGIS can read GeoJSON, but a 700 MB JSON file is unwieldy and difficult to manipulate. The code below is nevertheless useful and worth recording for the future."
