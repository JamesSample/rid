# Riverine Inputs and Direct Discharges (RID) Programme (Elveoverv√•kingsprogrammet)

This repository includes code for **estimating pollutant loads to Norwegian coastal waters**. The work is part of a joint  monitoring programme under the [OSPAR Commission](https://www.ospar.org/) for the *Protection of the Marine Environment of the Northeast Atlantic*. The main purpose is to estimate total loads of selected pollutants draining annually to Convention waters from inland water bodies.

The Norwegian component of the programme involves collaboration between [NIVA](http://www.niva.no/), [NIBIO](http://www.nibio.no/) and [NVE](https://www.nve.no/), and is supported by the [Norwegain Environment Agency](http://www.miljodirektoratet.no/en/). The code available in this repository was produced by NIVA.

The analysis for 2016/17 is documented in the following notebooks:

 1. **[Initial data exploration](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/rid/blob/master/notebooks/rid_data_exploration.ipynb)**. Getting to know the project and exploring the results from previous years
 
 2. **[Updating discharge datasets](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/rid/blob/master/notebooks/update_flow_datasets.ipynb)**. Adding new observed and modelled flow datasets from [NVE](https://www.nve.no/)
 
 3. **[Estimating loads at "monitored locations"](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/rid/blob/master/notebooks/estimate_loads.ipynb)**. 155 sites in the Norwegian component of the programme have at least some water chemistry measurements. This notebook estimates pollutant loads for these locations, using a combination of observed flows & discharges, modelled flows and regression analysis. Results for 2015 are estimated using the new code and compared to those reported previously

 4. **[Preparing input files for TEOTIL and running the model](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/rid/blob/master/notebooks/prepare_teotil_inputs.ipynb)**. For parts of Norway where monitoring data are unavailable, the model [TEOTIL](https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/214825) is used to estimate nutrient loads (nitrogen and phosphorus). This notebook describes the data processing required to generate input files for the model and compares the output from the new workflow with previous results.
 
 5. **[Summary tables in Microsoft Word](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/rid/blob/master/notebooks/word_data_tables.ipynb)**. Preparing key data tables for the report
